This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Read in the data, this reads the CSV, takes any blanks in the dataset and turns them into NA's
```{r}
carData <- read.csv("cleanedCarData.csv", header = TRUE,sep = ";")
carData
library(dplyr)
library(rpart)
```

```{r}
str(carData)
```

more data cleaning exploring...
This next bit of code takes only the numeric values in our dataset, which are year and odometer
```{r}
continuous <-select_if(carData, is.numeric)
options(scipen=10)
summary(continuous)
```
This next bit takes all of the factors, we've taken our categorical variables and turned them into factors. 
```{r}
factor <- data.frame(select_if(carData, is.factor))
	ncol(factor)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
graph <- lapply(names(factor),
    function(x) 
	ggplot(factor, aes(get(x))) +
		geom_bar() +
		theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)))
graph
```

```{r}
# Plot model price
ggplot(carData, aes(x = manufacturer, fill = price)) +
    geom_bar(position = "fill") + theme_classic()
```
```{r}
ggplot(carData, aes(x = manufacturer, y = price)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    stat_summary(fun = mean,
        geom = "point",
        size = 3,
        color = "steelblue") +
    theme_classic()
```
correlation
```{r}
#install.packages("GGally")
library(GGally)
# Convert data to numeric
corr <- data.frame(lapply(carData, as.integer))
# Plot the graph
ggcorr(corr,
    method = c("pairwise", "spearman"),
    nbreaks = 6,
    hjust = 0.8,
    label = TRUE,
    label_size = 3,
    color = "grey50")
	
```
